# Naked-PHP-Bootstrap-Structure
Basic file and directory structure designed to help you convert HTML based templates to PHP.

## Purpose of this Code
When I am creating a new website from sratch, I frequently use a custome template, and these templates are often made by third parties and mostly consist of HTML. Since I am making a PHP based database driven website, I have to convert their HTML template into usable PHP files.
To make it easier to convert the HTML template into PHP files, I have created this basic structure to speed up the process.
This repository contains the the empty files and folder structure, plus instructions on how to convert the HTML template into PHP. It does not work out of the box and is not intended to.
