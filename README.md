# Naked-PHP-Bootstrap-Structure
Basic file and directory structure designed to help you convert HTML based templates to PHP.

## Purpose of this Code
You can use this code in two ways:

1. To take an existing HTML based template and reassemble it into a PHP / MySQL file structure.
2. To use as a baser for an HTML template you are creating so that can easily be used with PHP / MySQL.

This repository contains the the empty files and folder structure, plus instructions on how to convert the HTML template into PHP. It does not work out of the box and is not intended to. It's just here to save you some time.

## What you Will Need

1. This set of naked files.
2. An HTML based template you want to convert.
3. Code yopu wish to use to connect to the database.
4. A basic understanding of HTML, PHP, Javascript, MySQL and copy and pasting.

Additionally, you may also need:

4. To download the latest versions of Bootstrap, JQuesry or other libraries, if your template uses them, or you intend on using them.
5. The code necessary to connect with your login or user management system.

For example, your HTML template may come with a copy of Boostrap, but it is not the most secure version. You would want to update it. But make sure that you update to the same major version of Bootstrap. Update version 3.x to the latest version of 3, or update version 4 to the latest version of 4. Versions 4 is not backwards compatible with 3.

I, another example, is if you have a script that handles user sessions. You would want to integrate the appropriate code into your pages so that it works. This would be different for each user management system.

## Why
When I am creating a new website from sratch, I frequently use a custom template, and these templates are often made by third parties and mostly consist of HTML. Since I am making a PHP based database driven website, I have to convert their HTML template into usable PHP files.

To make it easier to convert the HTML template into PHP files, I have created this basic structure to speed up the process.

I figured that I am not the only one with this task, so I am sharing the code here for everyone to use.
